*In this task, I created a machine learning model using Python and the Scikit-learn library. The model was trained to understand and classify data â€” for example, to detect if a message is spam or not. I used a dataset, split it into training and testing parts, and then built a prediction model. Finally, I checked how accurate the model is by testing it and showing the results in graphs and a report. Everything was done in a Jupyter Notebook.*
